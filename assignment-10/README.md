A web-safe font is a font that does not require a license and is safe to use on any browser.  This means it will always look the way it is supposed to no matter which browser someone may be using.  A system font is a font that only you may have a license too.  This means that this font may have come with the systems you already use or you may have purchased a license for it.  These are tricky because they do not always work or look the same to others, making a fallback font necessary.  A web font is a font that you can use from the web such as I have done in this assignment.  It works on some browsers but not all, making a fallback font necessary.
fallback fonts are necessary because the initial font is not always compatible with all browsers.  Fallback fonts still allow people to read the text with a font that is still readable and flows with the webpage.
For this assignment I read the material ahead of time and took notes.  Then I watched the walkthrough video once before starting the assignment.  Then I got started on my webpage and watched the video a second time as I went through the assignment.  I had my webpage open to make sure that I was doing the steps correctly.
