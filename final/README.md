Going into this class I knew absolutely nothing about web development.  I had only ever used Wix to create websites.  In this class I learned what repositories are and how they work and how to set up a repository in atom and push those updates to Github.  
As for web design, I learned how to add photos, text, media, videos, forms, tables, color, font, positioning and so much more through coding in atom.  I had zero knowledge going into this course, so everything we covered was knew information to me.  I now feel confident forming the basics of a website using html and css.
For this assignment I reviewed all of my past repositories to remember what all we had gone over.  Then I began to build my site, adding all of the content first and then styling and positioning last.  I had my live site pulled up the whole time to make sure my updates were going through.  While I did borrow ideas from past assignments, I made sure to make the style and positioning of this assignment unique to this website.  Since I am a business major, I did not have a portfolio of my own to showcase, so I built a website for a travel photographer who is sharing their photos on the web.
