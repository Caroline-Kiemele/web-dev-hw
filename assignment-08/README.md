While this wasn't a new thing we learned this week, I found forms to be the hardest part of this assignment.  Learning how to style and use nav elements I found to be fairly easy but forms are still intimidating to me.  The different styling elements were interesting, although I struggled with aligning the images the way I wanted them too.  
I am interested to learn about different fonts and font sizing in CSS.  However, I'm also nervous about styling because it seems very tedious.
For this assignment I read through the models on our class website and then watched the walkthrough video once.  Then I watched it again as I went through the first steps of the assignment.  The review pages were really helpful for this assignment and I watched some of the walkthrough videos from previous assignments as I got into forms to refresh my memory. While this assignment was long and tedious, I did not find it too confusing.
