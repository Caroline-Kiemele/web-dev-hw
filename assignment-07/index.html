      <h2>Colors Lyrics</h2>
      <p>Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
      You said your mother only smiled on her tv show
      You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
      I hope you make it to the day you're twenty-eight years old</p>

      <p>You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
      You're spilling like an overflowing sink
      You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
      And now i'm tearing through the pages and the ink</p>

      <p>Everything is blue
      His pills, his hands, his jeans
      And now i'm covered in the colors pull apart at the seams
      And it's blue
      And it's blue</p>

      <p>Everything is grey
      His hair, his smoke, his dreams
      And now he's so devoid of color
      He don't know what it means
      And he's blue
      And he's blue</p>

      <p>You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
      I know I've only felt religion when i've lied with you
      You said you'll never be forgiven till your boys are too
      And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you</p>

      <p>You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
      You're spilling like an overflowing sink
      You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
      And now I'm tearing through the pages and the ink</p>

      <p>Everything is blue
      His pills, his hands, his jeans
      And now I'm covered in the colors Pull apart at the seams
      And it's blue
      And it's blue</p>

      <p>Everything is grey
      His hair, his smoke, his dreams
      And now he's so devoid of color
      He don't know what it means
      And he's blue
      And he's blue</p>

      <p>You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
      But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
      Then you decided purple just wasn't for you</p>

      <p>Everything is blue
      His pills, his hands, his jeans
      And now I'm covered in the colors pull apart at the seams
      And it's blue
      And it's blue</p>

      <p>Everything is grey
      His hair, his smoke, his dreams
      And now he's so devoid of color
      He don't know what it means
      And he's blue
      And he's blue</p>
