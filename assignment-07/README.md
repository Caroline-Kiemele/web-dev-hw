1. Divs are used for structural clarity and to help identify and divide different element groups.  Classes uses the same name value to group similar elements together.  Id's are a unique identifier that sets an element apart from other elements.  Spans help to group elements together that need extra organization or styling.  
2. "alt text" makes websites more accessible.  If someone is disabled and uses a screen reader the alt text will describe to them what an image or table or video is about.
3. This assignment was especially tricky. I started with doing the reading first. Then I watched the video through once and then watched it again as I completed the steps done in the walkthough video.  After that I went back through the steps of the assignment and finished the remains steps. I found some of the steps especially tedious such as the styling and copyright sections of the assignment.  However, I found the walkthrough video especially helpful.
