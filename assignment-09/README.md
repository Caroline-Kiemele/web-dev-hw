A universal selector is used universally for every item on the page. You would use this when a rule should apply to very basic elements. A element selector is used for a certain type of element, such as an image or text element.  This would be used if a rule needed to apply to all h2 headings and so on.  A class selector is used for elements that all serve the same function.  This would not be used to alter one specific element, but multiple elements in the same "class".  An ID selector is usually used for an individual element.  You should not use an ID selector for multiple elements. An ID selector would not be used on a class element.
I picked an 80s color palette because I loved how vibrant the colors from that decade were.  I choose the colors, Powersuit(#ee3e80), Pacman(#FBE608), and Acid Wash (rgb(38, 139, 210)) because they were all so different from each other but still represented the 80s.  I used codes that were as close to the colors as I could find.
IN the instructions you tell us to site our work.  I am not sure where you want us to do this on the webpage so for this assignment I will had my works cited below.
