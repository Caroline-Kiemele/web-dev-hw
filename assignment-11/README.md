Padding is the amount of space between the content inside of the element and the actual element, whereas a margin is the space between different elements.  Borders, on the other hand, help to define elements and helping to differentiate them from other elements.

I found this assignment trickier than most.  As usual I started out watching the walkthrough video first.  After creating my webpage I had difficulty uploading my site-sketch to my site.  After eventually uploading it I had some issues with spacing my site links.  I wanted to space them apart from each other 1em but every time I tried to do this it would also give it a top margin of 1em which moved it outside of the banner.  I am still finding margins to be tricky and seem to still not have gotten the hang of them.  I also had issues centering the word "logo" in the logo.  I followed the instructions from the video but they text just would not center.
