# Assignment 04
I visited The University of Montana's website in 2002.  The content is less organized and the different pages are formatted more similar to an essay than a modern day website.  Everything is really blocky.  Today their website is much cleaner and simple, making it easier to navigate and read through web pages.
It was tricky at first to navigate through the module until I found the snapshots for each site and then it became incredibly easy to use.  I think The Wayback Machine just lacks clear instructions on how it's site should be used.  Overall I found the module very helpful and will likely use it again.
