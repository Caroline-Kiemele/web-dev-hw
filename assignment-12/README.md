My client was a travel blogger whose main focus in their blog is to provide tips on the easiest and most efficient ways to travel.  They want to help people save money while traveling and encourage people to get into the outdoors.  They wanted a minimalist style for their website to help symbolize their minimalist lifestyle.
Unlike display:inline, display:inline-block allows us to change the width and height of an element along with top and bottom margins and padding. And unlike display:block, display:inline-block does not add a line-break so that the element can be positioned next to other elements.  
I found this assignment to be the most difficult yet.  I am not sure if there is something wrong with my browser or if it is just incredibly slow but changes that I make to my website either have not decided to upload onto my site or take a couple hours to.  I am using google chrome on a Dell laptop.  I have not had this issue with previous assignments but have with this one.  As usual I followed along with the tutorial video and then altered my web design to give it my own style.  I looked back at previous styling from past assignments to help me with position but as I stated above, still had issues uploading them to my website.  I will send you an email about this but I am wondering if when you view my site if everything upload correctly and my browser is just acting strange or if something is wrong in my repo that is not allowing changes to be pushed through.
