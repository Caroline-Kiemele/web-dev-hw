I am currently a sophomore in Management Information Systems in the Business School.  Last semester I took the into to MIS class and was encouraged by my professor to take as many tech and web development classes as possible as MIS is a tech based profession.  Having basic knowledge on how to create a website is a valuable skillset to have on a resume.

So far I have learned what repo and directories are.  I hope to learn more about coding for websites and how to upload a finished website onto the internet.
